# Django Project

## About
This is my second Django project transferred on to the second, school account and is a login app.
It is also being expanded to include a shopping cart option.

## How to use
To start, install the required packages using the requirement.txt
This step will require the [virtual ven module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (this will require admin access)

This can be done by entering in
